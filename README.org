"[[https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/pull/1288#issuecomment-15880199][This is what connection adapters are for.]]"

The example in =adapter.py= shows a basic implementation of a transport adapter that supports a =src_addr= keyword argument for specifying the source address. It has the following limitations:

- Requires Python 2.7+ for source address support in =httplib= or =http.client=.
- Not tested with Python 3.
- Supports only HTTPS.
- Doesn't validate SSL credentials.
